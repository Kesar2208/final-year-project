# Trends Analysis and Sales Prediction for Cars and Two-Wheelers Across Fuel Types

> Forecasting the shift from petrol/diesel to EV and CNG vehicles in India using machine learning and time-series analysis

---

## Abstract

This project explores vehicle sales trends and forecasts for different fuel types—petrol, diesel, electric vehicles (EV), and compressed natural gas (CNG)—in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Delhi. Using machine learning and time-series forecasting methods (ARIMA, Linear Regression, S-curve), the study models future adoption rates, infrastructure growth, and policy impacts on consumer behavior. The goal is to predict when EV and CNG vehicle sales will surpass traditional fuel vehicles and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Results

- Delhi: EVs expected to outsell diesel by 2026 and petrol by 2027  
- Mumbai: EV/CNG crossover projected by 2028–29  
- Decline in petrol/diesel consumption by ~50% by 2030  
- Doubling of EV charging stations by 2027  
- CNG growth steady, especially in commercial vehicles
